# About
This is the `android` branch. If you are intrested, hack it.

# Configuration

## Install QPython
Released apk is [here](https://github.com/qpython-android/qpython/releases), download and install it on your phone.

## Install requests
You can rewrite the script using `urllib` and `urllib2` to avoid the dependence on `requests` library. QPython has extended tools to alow you to use `pip` to install python packages, so `requests` can be installed using pip extended tool.

## Run
Comment or uncomment the code in `__main__`  function to change `ucas` or `china unicom` option.

# Attention
During test, my QPython seems only to support ascii character, so I remove relevant code to make it run.
